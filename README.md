# Fruits_Slice_Game
It's a very nice Fruits Slice Game. In which users have to slice the fruits and simultaneously users get the one point and user's score will increase accordingly. If the users miss the fruit then he/she will loss one trial and if user miss all the initial 3 trials then the game will over.
